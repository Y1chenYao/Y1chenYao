### This is Yichen :herb:
A sophomore majoring in CS @ Cornell and developer @ Hack4Impact :earth_asia:. 

Things I have been doing:
- :keyboard: full-stack development, computer vision/machine learning
- :movie_camera: video editing, game strategizing
- :paintbrush: Procreate, part-time at the Johnson Museum of Arts
- :musical_keyboard: classical piano pieces

> Note: The account only holds limited repo that I've been worked on, since most projects/schoolwork are on the Cornell Enterprise account (not open to the public sadly).
